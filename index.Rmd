## Introducing the Open Data Format

The Open Data Format (ODF) is a new, non-proprietary, multilingual, 
metadata enriched, and zip-compressed data format. 
The ODF meets the FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management 
and stewardship.

A data file in the Open Data Format has the ".zip"-extension. It is
a zip-compressed folder containing the raw dataset in a comma-seperated 
file (CSV) and the metadata in an XML-file structured in the DDI Codebook 
metadata standard. For further information on the specification of the 
Open Data Format you can read the [Specification](specification.html).

To work with data files in the Open Data Format the [R Package opendataformat](r-package.html) and the 
[Stata package opendf](stata-package.html) are available at the moment. 
A python package is in the making.

You can download an example data file in the Open Data Format (<a href="/files/example_dataset.zip" download>example_dataset.zip</a>). Manuals for generating data files in ODF can be found on 
[GitHub](https://github.com/opendataformat/Specification/tree/main/Generating%20Open%20Data%20Format) for Stata, R and Python.

## About the Project

Researchers in the social sciences use various software for statistical
analysis of rectangular, structured data (e.g., Stata, R). Each software
has a specific data format that is only partially compatible, if at all,
with other software solutions. The non-interoperability of data formats
is an obstacle to replication studies and data-reuse. It undermines the
FAIR principles and is not in line with the idea of open science. To
meet the needs of data users, data producers offer a variety of data
formats by doing a lot of redundant work, which is error-prone and leads
to increasing costs. Furthermore, there is not only a demand for
different data formats but also for material that describes the data;
this includes, for example, study descriptions, method reports,
codebooks, or questionnaires. As of now, it is common practice for
scientists to have to leave their statistical software environment to
search for supplementary material while performing the analysis of their
data, as this material is often accessible through external data
portals. This practice is inconvenient and prone to errors.

The open, metadata-enriched, non-proprietary data dissemination format
(ODF) is a project of KonsortSWD, the NFDI consortium for the social,
behavioural, educational and economic sciences to develop a data format 
that adheres to the FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management 
and stewardship.The project includes three main work aspects:

1.  The specification of a new open data format and the documentation of 
    the specificationsâ€™ development is the core work
    that runs through the entire project. We start with a minimal but
    scalable specification and aim to evolve it into a specification
    that is suitable for a wide range of use cases.
2.  For a new data format to be usable with existing statistical software, the
    project develops statistical packages with import and export filters 
    for a selection of software programs (Stata, R) to use the ODF 
    within the software. 
3.  Promote the new data format to bring it in widespread use by various 
    research data centers and other data providers.
    
The result of the project is the Open Data Format (ODF).
